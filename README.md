# Squid-Remake
Hello!

This is PixelToad with the first release of Squid Beatz PC (Originally named Squid Beatz 3).
I'm new to this kind of stuff so, /:
If you have anything to report, you can go to the Splatoon 3 discord server and find the Squid Beatz Remake Discussion in the posts or you can message me directly with my username 'pixeltoad' on Discord.

This is open source so feel free to open it in the Godot 4 editor and look around and mabye even make a chart with the primitive editor.
At least it is better than doing it by hand like I did for my first 3 songs.

I will try to keep consistently updating the project to make it better. More info is in the SBRD in the S3 Discord Server.
