# Squid-Remake

**-----Update Post: 29th January 2025-----**
Geez it's been a while since I've looked back here
This is the older version of the project so here's the new link: https://github.com/PixelBiter/Squid-Beatz

**-----Update Post: 13th September 2023-----**

Hello!
Should've put this notification here earlier but I have made a better remake of Squid Beatz in another repository
You can check out my Squid-Beatz repository for it




**-----Update Post: 7th November 2023-----**

Hello Again!
This is PixelToad again, here to bring a small update on what is going on with the remake.

I've taken a break from the game due to exams occurring (as well as procrastination) so I can't work on it as much, but I'm slowly working on Squid Beatz 2 PC.
SB2PC is a remade version of the game with the features of Squid Beatz 2 being put in before anything else.
That means I'm reworking note spawning, the song reading, sprites, etc.
I'm slowly getting through it, but no release date for the updated version will be available for a while since this is a single dev project (And that dev is me!)

Just reminders, feel free to join the discussion on the Splatoon 3 server on the Q&A posts in Squid Beatz Remake Discussion(Discord Server: https://discord.gg/splatoon )
Also feel free to @ me or message me directly on Discord.

This project is completely open source since it is mainly a practice project and something nice to put out as a first big project as a game dev.
It being open source means you can use all the charts, software and sprites within the project, but please do credit the work by putting a link to this Github on the project or just mentioning it.

That is about all I have to say about the project so, cya!

- Signing off, PixelToad



**-----Update Post: 1st October 2023-----**

Hello!

This is PixelToad with the first release of Squid Beatz PC (Originally named Squid Beatz 3).
I'm new to this kind of stuff so, /:
If you have anything to report, you can go to the Splatoon 3 discord server and find the Squid Beatz Remake Discussion in the posts or you can message me directly with my username 'pixeltoad' on Discord.

This is open source so feel free to open it in the Godot 4 editor and look around and mabye even make a chart with the primitive editor.
At least it is better than doing it by hand like I did for my first 3 songs.

I will try to keep consistently updating the project to make it better. More info is in the SBRD in the S3 Discord Server.
